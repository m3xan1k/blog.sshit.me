Summary: Github actions setup for this blog


What it does. I write new post locally, push changes to github repo, blog content compiles and delivers to server that hosts a site. So new post will appear on site in a minute after my push to github.


Example config

```
name: deploy-blog
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master

jobs:
  build_content:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: setup python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v2
        with:
          python-version: '3.10'
      
      - name: install dependencies
        working-directory: ./site
        run: python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
      
      - name: compile site content
        working-directory: ./site
        run: pelican content -o output -s publishconf.py

      - name: copy compiled site via ssh
        uses: appleboy/scp-action@master
        with:
          host: ${{ secrets.PROD_SERVER_HOST }}
          port: ${{ secrets.PROD_SERVER_PORT }}
          username: ${{ secrets.PROD_SERVER_USER }}
          key: ${{ secrets.PROD_SERVER_KEY }}
          source: './site/output/*'
          target: ~${{ secrets.PROD_SERVER_USER }}/blog
          rm: true
```

Each step with explaination.

* Triggers by push into 'master' branch

```
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master
```
>

* Consists of single job named 'build_content'

```
jobs:
  build_content:
```
>


* Uses ubuntu as environment system

```
runs-on: ubuntu-latest
```
>

**Has several steps**

* Default step, required by github actions. I have no idea what it does, but your workflow will fail without it, so just go with it

```
- uses: actions/checkout@v2
```
>

* Setup python with specific version. This is required to run python related commands

```
- name: setup python
  uses: actions/setup-python@v2
  with:
    python-version: '3.10'
```
>

* Then i run multiple python commands. Intall dependencies from `requirements.txt` file and compile site content with pelican(pythonic static site generator that i use). Pay attention for `working-directory` directive, github actions missing `ls` command, so you need to define each step context if it makes sense

```
- name: install dependencies
  working-directory: ./site
  run: python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
    
- name: compile site content
  working-directory: ./site
  run: pelican content -o output -s publishconf.py
```
>

* Last step is to use 'scp' action to copy compiled site to production server

```
- name: copy compiled site via ssh
  uses: appleboy/scp-action@master
  with:
    host: ${{ secrets.PROD_SERVER_HOST }}
    port: ${{ secrets.PROD_SERVER_PORT }}
    username: ${{ secrets.PROD_SERVER_USER }}
    key: ${{ secrets.PROD_SERVER_KEY }}
    source: './site/output/*'
    target: ~${{ secrets.PROD_SERVER_USER }}/blog
    rm: true
```

Pipeline is done. On server side site is proudly served by nginx.
