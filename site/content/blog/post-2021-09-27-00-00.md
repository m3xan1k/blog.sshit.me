Summary: Sometimes you have broken locale on remote server console.

If you have this mistake on remote server

```
apt-listchanges: Can't set locale; make sure $LC_* and $LANG are correct!

Somehow you have broken/missing locale vars.

Fix this with command on remote server

```
sudo update-locale LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 LANG=en_US.UTF-8
